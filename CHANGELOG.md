# Changelog

All packages (`@minamojs/minamo`, `@minamojs/lambda-df`) share one version.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 (2026-09-25)

- `@minamojs/lambda-df`: `signal` no longer retries a failing `publish` with the SDK's default retry strategy (6 attempts); it runs once, as on every engine (#1).
- `@minamojs/lambda-df`: a step result over Lambda's 256 KB STEP checkpoint limit (for example, a long `model()` stream) now fails that step with an error naming the step and its size, instead of failing at checkpoint time (#2).
- `@minamojs/minamo`: `ToolContext` has `call`, the `ToolCall` being run, so tools no longer parse the call ID out of `idempotencyKey` (#3).
- `@minamojs/lambda-df`: `retry: { backoffRate: undefined }` no longer overrides the SDK's default backoff rate, which made every delay after the first `NaN` seconds (#5). Only the fields of `Retry` reach the SDK; undeclared SDK options such as `retryableErrors` are no longer forwarded, so a policy behaves the same on every engine.

## 0.1.0-alpha.0 (2026-09-24)

First alpha, published to npm with the `alpha` dist-tag.

- `@minamojs/minamo`: the `Durable` interface (`step`, `scope`, `signal`), declarative `Retry`, a JSON codec that keeps `Uint8Array`, `model()` for one durable step per model call, and `runTools()` for concurrent tool calls with a deterministic journal.
- `@minamojs/minamo/memory`: in-memory engine for tests, with replay, crash injection, and signals.
- `@minamojs/lambda-df`: engine for AWS Lambda durable functions.
- `examples/lambda-bedrock`: a deployable support agent on Lambda durable functions with Amazon Bedrock Converse and human approval.
